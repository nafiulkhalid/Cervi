# Cervi â€“ Cervical Cancer Spot Detection App

Cervi is an iOS app designed to assist with preliminary visual analysis of cervical health using images from endoscopic cameras. It compares uploaded cervix images to pre-labeled datasets and reports the likelihood of being cancerous or non-cancerous based on visible white spot detection using HSV image processing.

## Image Processing Logic

- **Color Space:** HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)
- **White Spot Detection:** Based on high brightness and low saturation pixels
- **Confidence Score:** Ratio of white spots to total image pixels
- **Classification Threshold:**
  - `> 5%` white spot ratio â†’ **Cancerous**
  - `â‰¤ 5%` white spot ratio â†’ **Non-cancerous**
